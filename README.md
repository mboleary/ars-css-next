# Ars CSS NEXT

The next version of Stylesheets for my website as well as some other projects.

This project uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), and is required in order to compile the stylesheets.

The style system is designed to be modular and provide a framework by which beautiful projects can be created. Some demo components are included to show off these styles.

## Getting started

### Compiling

To compile the scss code to css, run this:

```sh
sass scss/main.scss build/main.css
```

This should also create the `build` directory, which the `runDemos.sh` script relies on.

### Running the demo projects
