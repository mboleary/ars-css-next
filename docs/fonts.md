# Fonts

Ars NEXT uses [League Mono](https://github.com/theleagueof/league-mono) as its font.

## Downloading the fonts

Since the fonts are not bundled with this repo, you will need to download them manually.

1. Goto (https://github.com/theleagueof/league-mono/releases/)[https://github.com/theleagueof/league-mono/releases/] and download the latest release

2. Create a folder named `font` in the root directory of this repo (you know, where the README.md file is) if there isn't one already

3. Copy the following fonts into that folder:

/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-Bold.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-ExtraBold.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-Light.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-Medium.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-Regular.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-SemiBold.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-Thin.woff2
/LeagueMono-2.220/static/WOFF2/LeagueMono-UltraLight.woff2

4. Now, the next time you run `./runDemos.sh`, these fonts should be included.
